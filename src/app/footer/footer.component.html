        <h5>About this site:</h5>
        <p>
           This site serves two purposes: a place for a prospective employer to get information, and a place where Curtis LayCraft can learn/experiment with new technologies. It is built using feature branching on Github.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a node.js web application built in Angular. The UI is built with Bootstrap 4. It is being versioned through Github, and automatically deployed through a Heroku pipeline.

        <h5>The future:</h5>
        <p>The next big thing is to convert all the CSS to SASS and add some images. So I need to learn SASS and go digging through my old graphic design stuff. Also I need a new picture that matches the quirkiness of the colour scheme.</p>
