              Curtis was part of a student team working with Cloud Compass Computing Inc. The project is StackButton and it provides a status-board for monitoring multiple cloud-deployed software tools.  StackButton is written in Angular 4.0 and is deployed in a Docker container. It is designed for Red Hat's OpenShift platform and collects API information.

Curtis’ pet project was the mobile enabled version of BCGov’s MyHR built on the JavaScript rendering product built by Greyheller; this involved working with multiple vendors and contractors to create a user-friendly mobile version of the Time and Leave System.
