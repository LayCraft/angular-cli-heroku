    <p class="lead">He wants to join a great team. You should give him a job.</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Curtis was a graphic designer but recently graduated and now has a computer science diploma. He intends to bring applied communication into software development. Art and logic? Maybe you should hire him.</p>
    <p>This page is a generic skeleton front page. Chances are that you are a prospective employer considering me for a position. This page is part of an active automated deployment branch through Github and Heroku. You are looking at the git master. All of the changes happening behind the scenes are happening in other branches. Lots of changes to come as I migrate my LayCraftDesign repo into this one. The original source is forked from <a href="https://github.com/chenkie/angular-cli-heroku/">Chenkie's angular-cli-heroku starter.</a> Deploying Angular to Heroku is still a very new thing.</p>
