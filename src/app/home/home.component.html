                <p>Curtis graduated from Camosun College's Computer Systems Technology in the summer of 2017. The CST program's focus is on applied technology experience and it gives students a wide variety of applied computer science and software engineering experiences. Curtis achieved dean's honour every Camosun academic term. In his personal life, he enjoys experimenting with new development frameworks, hacking devices, improving the home network, doing Arduino projects, and many other geeky things.

                  At the BC Public Service Agency, Curtis joined the Time and Leave Project team for a six month co-op as application support during the product rollout. Curtis learned documentation, reporting, project management strategies, system troubleshooting, process development, and system analyst workflows. The core focus of the work was supporting the project. Curtis was responsible for troubleshooting access issues post-deployment within the BC Government internal network. Curtis’ pet project was the mobile enabled version of BCGov’s MyHR built on PeopleMobile built by Greyheller; this involved working with multiple vendors and contractors to create a user-friendly mobile version of the Time and Leave System.
